<b>ePursuit</b> connects to Asterisk and sets up a telephone bot which is capable of calling all Mr X, recording where they are and sending these recordings to the detectives.<br />
It is very easy to configure once you have Asterisk configured with the SIP provider of your choice.<br>

Project committed. The version right now (in the SVN trunk) does only one call cycle. I am working on a fully customizable autimatic call cycle so that no user interaction what-so-ever is needed.<br>
